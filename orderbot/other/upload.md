<h1>Upload</h1>
Uploads and parses a {tag}.txt file in order to create a new markov model, based on the contents of the file.<br>
The user that is kicked will receive a message with the server and reason for the kick, if they have DMs enabled.<br>
A reason can be attached if specified.<br>

Usage:  <code>upload {attached file}</code><br>
Notice: The tag must be a minimum of <strong>1</strong> character, and a maximum of <strong>15</strong> characters. The command can time out if nothing is uploaded within 60 seconds.

Example:<br> 
<code>!upload</code> will tell you to upload a {tag.txt}, which will be parsed if it is in your next message.<br>
<code>!upload {file.txt}</code> will attempt to make a new model with the tag <strong>file</strong>
