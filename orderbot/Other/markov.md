<h1>Markov</h1>
Uses a markov chain to generate sentences based on a dataset.<br>
The dataset can be uploaded via the <strong>!upload</strong> command, and all uploaded tags can be used with this command.

Usage:  <code>markov {tag}</code><br>

Example:<br> 
<code>!markov beemovie</code> will return a generated sentence, e.g "Freeze! He looks like a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a badfella!"<br>
<code>!markov bad_tag</code> will say "This tag does not exist within the markov database." and return the list of existing tags.
