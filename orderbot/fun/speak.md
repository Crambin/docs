<h1>Speak</h1>

Can be used to speak to the integrated chatbot (using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/async-cleverbot/">Travitia API</a>)<br>
This works on a per-channel context basis, meaning the bot will use previously spoken messages to "continue" a conversation, similar to Cleverbot.

Notice: The input has to be a minimum of **3** characters, and a maximum of **60** characters.

Usage:  <code>speak {query}</code>

Example:<br> 
<code>!speak hey</code> Will give a response, such as "Hi, how are you?"<br>
